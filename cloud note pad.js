alert(`Hi Everyone, I Am Really Excited For This App Today!

This Is A Full Stack App (NodeJS + EJS) Due To Which I Could Not Place The App Source Code In Sololearn!

But, If You Still Want The Source Code, It Is Available Publically On Github: https://github.com/sancho1952007/Cloud-Notepad

Don't Forget To Like This Code Since Coding Full Stack Codes Take More Time And Effort To Make The Amazing Results!

Upvotes target: 70!

Also, Comment What You Stored In It!

And, Don't Forget To Follow Me Because There Are More Amazing Codes (Better Than This) Coming!

If You Are Curious To Know How It Works, It Collects Your Public Network IP Address Encrypts It And Stores It Into Deta Space Collection

So, Since Your Network IP Is The Same For All Devices Connected To That Network, It Will Load The Same Text Related To The Key Of Your Re-Encrypted IP Address

YOUR IP ADDRESS IS ENCRYPTED USING MD5 ALGORITHM AND STORED SO, NO ONE CAN SEE YOUR REAL IP (NOT EVEN ME)

ALSO, DON'T STORE PASSWORDS AND OTHER CRITICAL DATA SINCE THE TEXT IS VISIBLE TO ME AND ONLY IP ADDRESS IS ENCRYPTED!`);
